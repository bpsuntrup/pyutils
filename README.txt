==pyutils

Utilities and patterns I find generally cool/useful.

This has also become somewhat of a staging ground for new projects that 
bubble up. You'll find stuff in here occasionally that you won't find
in your usual utils package, like small games or programs that I find
useful as standalones. 

==License:
Be nice.
Use however you like.
Use at YOUR OWN RISK.
